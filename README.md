# The Catalog of Design Patterns

## Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Factory Method

*Factory Method* is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Examples: [**Dialog Rendering**](patterns/factory-method/dialog-rendering/README.md), [**Maze Game**](patterns/factory-method/maze-game/README.md)

## Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter

*Adapter* is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Examples: [**Adapter**](patterns/structural-patterns/adapter/README.md)
