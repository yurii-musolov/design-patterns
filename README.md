# The Catalog of Design Patterns

## Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Factory Method

*Factory Method* is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Examples: [**Dialog Rendering**](patterns/factory-method/dialog-rendering/README.md)
